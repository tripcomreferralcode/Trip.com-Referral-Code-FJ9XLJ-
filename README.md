# Trip.com Referral Code "FJ9XLJ" – Get 10% OFF on Hotels, Flights & Travel Bookings!

If you’re planning your next trip and want to save money, you’ll love this: by using the referral code “FJ9XLJ” when signing up with Trip.com, you can get 10% off on hotels, flights and other travel bookings (subject to terms and availability). In this blog post, I’ll walk you through what the Trip.com referral code is, how to use it, the benefits, the catch, tips to maximise the savings — and why you should act now.

## What is the Trip.com Referral Code?
The Trip.com referral code is a unique alphanumeric code that a user (existing customer) gives to a friend (new customer). When the friend signs up using that code (or referral link) and completes a qualifying booking (hotel, flight, etc.), both parties typically earn a reward. In this case, by using referral code “FJ9XLJ”, you – as the new user – are promised a discount of 10% on your booking.

## Why does this exist? 
Because Trip.com rewards new users and referrers to expand their user base. According to Trip.com’s “Invite & Earn” scheme, when you refer friends they register and book, you can receive Trip Coins, and the referred friend can get welcome deals. Trip.com+2Trip.com+2
So to summarise:

The referral code is for new user sign-up and first booking discount.
The same or another reward goes to the referring existing user.
Your code “FJ9XLJ” is being offered to you (new user) for 10% off.
Use it correctly to not miss out.

# How to Use the Trip.com Referral Code “FJ9XLJ”?

Here’s a step-by-step guide to using the code properly so you don’t miss the discount.
Steps:

Visit Trip.com (or download the Trip.com mobile app).

Sign up for a new account (as a new user).

During registration or at checkout, look for the field labelled “Referral Code”, “Promo Code”, “Invite Code” etc.

Enter FJ9XLJ in that field.

Browse and select your booking (hotel, flight, or travel package).

At payment/checkout stage, ensure the discount of ~10% is applied.

Finalise payment and keep records (booking confirmation, code used, discount shown).

Save any Trip Coins earned for future travel.


### Key Tips & Tricks

Make sure the code is entered before payment. Some bookings may not allow retroactive discount.

Confirm that the discount amount shows up in the booking summary.

Ensure you meet any minimum spend, booking category or region eligibility (if applicable).

Check if the referral discount is valid only for “first booking” / “new users” etc.

Switch currency to your local (₹ INR for India) to check exact discount value and whether it applies in your region.

Compare the final price with other sites even after discount — always good practice.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

Using the code after payment (won’t apply).

Using it with an existing account (won’t qualify as “new user”).

Ignoring terms such as “cannot be used with other promos”.

Forgetting to verify the discount is displayed before final confirmation.

## Terms & Conditions – What to Know?

Whenever a referral code is used, there are terms & conditions. While this code (“FJ9XLJ”) is being offered, you should still check Trip.com’s official terms. Here are common points:

### Key Terms to Check

**New user only:** The referred person must not have an existing Trip.com account.

**Valid booking types:** Hotel bookings? Flights? Both? Some codes restrict one.

**Minimum spend:** There might be a minimum booking value.

**Regions/Markets:** Discounts may be valid only in certain countries or regions.

**Expiry date:** The code may expire on a specified date.

**Non-stackable:** You may not combine it with other promo codes or site-wide discounts.

**Refund/cancellation policy:** If you cancel or change booking, discount may be void.

**Referral program rules:** Trip.com’s “Invite & Earn” scheme sets out rewards for referrer and referee.


### Example Terms Summarised

The referred friend signs up, books their first flight or hotel via Trip.com. Trip.com

The referrer gets Trip Coins or credit after the friend completes travel. Trip.com

Discount may apply only in certain markets (e.g., UK, US, Australia). Trip.com Australia+1

### A Tip: Keep Evidence
When you apply the code and book, take screenshots of:

The referral code entry field.

The discount reflected in the payment summary.

Booking confirmation email.

This helps in case you need to contact customer service about missing discount.

### Strategy for Maximum Savings

Sign up as a new user using “FJ9XLJ”.

Wait for a seasonal sale on the destination you’re interested in.

Use the referral discount + sale price.

Pay attention to cancellation/change policies (sometimes cheaper bookings are less flexible).

Book flights and hotels together if possible (package deals sometimes cheaper).

Use the Trip.com app (mobile) as app-only deals often appear.

## Step-By-Step Example Use Case

Here’s a hypothetical scenario showing how you might use the referral code in real life.
Example: Booking a Hotel in Bali

Let’s assume a hotel in Bali (4 nights) has a base fare of ₹12,000 on Trip.com before any discounts.

You sign up as new user, enter referral code FJ9XLJ.

The 10% discount is applied → you save ₹1,200 → effective booking cost becomes ₹10,800.

Simultaneously you check if there’s a “flash hotel deal – 20% off” on Trip.com for Bali. Suppose there is. You apply both (if stacking allowed) or the system automatically picks the better discount.

Booking final cost: maybe ₹9,000 (after stacking/referral) instead of ₹12,000.

You make payment and save the booking confirmation.

Later you write a review (if required) to earn Trip Coins for your next trip.

You’re happy. You travel. You use less money thanks to the referral code.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q1: Is the Trip.com referral code “FJ9XLJ” valid forever?
A: Not necessarily. Most referral codes and promotions have expiry dates, and may be valid only in certain regions. Always enter the code and check if discount is applied during booking.
Q2: Can I use the referral code if I already have a Trip.com account?
A: Usually not. Referral codes are typically meant for new users or first-time bookings. If you already have an account, the code may be invalid.
Q3: Does the 10% discount apply to flights and hotels both?
A: Generally yes, but it depends on the terms for that particular referral or region. Always confirm at checkout that the discount is applied for your booking type.
Q4: Can I combine the referral code with other promo codes?
A: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Many deals specify “cannot be combined with other offers”. At checkout, the system may automatically apply the best one. Check terms.
Q5: What happens if I cancel my booking?
A: If you cancel or change your booking, the discount may be void or you may lose part of it. Always check the cancellation policy and whether the discount still stands in changed circumstances.
Q6: Where can I find more Trip.com offers beyond the referral code?
A: On Trip.com’s official “Deals” page and Coupon aggregators. There are many current promo codes listed (hotels, flights, car rentals etc.). Trip.com+1

## Things to Watch Out For

The discount may exclude taxes and fees — meaning “10% less” might apply only to base fare, not full price including extras. For example in the UK, a similar code gave an average 7.13% off, because taxes/fees weren’t discounted.

If the code isn’t applied properly, you may pay full price. Always verify.

Some bookings (e.g., flexible fares, certain hotels) may restrict promo code use.

Region-specific terms: The code may not work in India (Haryana/Faridabad region) if the promotion is for other markets. Always test.

The listed “10% off” might be a best-case or approximate. Real discount may differ.

Reputation matters: While Trip.com is legitimate, always compare price to other platforms.
